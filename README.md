## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

1. I found myself stuck on Challenge 6, question 2: What is the opening tag of the HTML element you appended your newly created <p> element to? 
    - When I thought of opening tag, I thought it was speaking about the tag I used (<p>) when creating the new DOM element.
